zMVC example
============

This example should illustrate how to quickly create an application using zMVC. While it might seem unnecessary to perform some of the steps documented in this example, it should at least point out how one can quickly sketch an application that is maintainable and can be built upon.

## Running the example

First resolve all the dependencies using NPM :

    npm install

Then run the following Grunt task:

    grunt start

this task will launch a browser which will preview the application. You can also adjust the sources and monitor the changes in realtime as the task synchronizes a file watcher with the browser.
